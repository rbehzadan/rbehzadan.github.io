## Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I've been meaning to set up a personal website for a long time â€” a place to collect my thoughts, document experiments, share the things I'm building (or breaking), and simply keep track of what I'm learning along the way.

This site is not just a blog. It's also a vault where I'll archive useful notes, procedures, configs, and ideas â€” things that I often end up writing down in scattered files or losing inside forgotten notebooks. Now, I'll try to keep them organized here, both for myself and for anyone else who might find them useful.

Some posts will probably be technical deep-dives. Others might just be quick notes to future-me: "Here's how you solved that weird bug the last time." Iâ€™ll share experiments that work, and maybe a few that don't â€” that's part of the learning process too.

And while I'm at it, Iâ€™ll be honest:
I also hope that having a public site like this helps me connect with others, and maybe even makes me a little easier to find for potential employers. (If youâ€™re reading this and you're hiring, feel free to get in touch! ðŸ˜„)

Thanks for visiting â€” and here's to building, breaking, learning, and sharing more in the open.

See you around.
