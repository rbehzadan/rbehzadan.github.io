Hi, I'm **Reza Behzadan** — a developer passionate about building software, exploring technology, and sharing knowledge.

This website is my personal vault where I:
- Share my **dotfiles** and **scripts** 🛠️
- Post **technical notes** and **articles** 📚
- Showcase **small projects** I work on 🚀

I enjoy learning, solving problems, and working across a wide range of technologies, from web development to system programming.
